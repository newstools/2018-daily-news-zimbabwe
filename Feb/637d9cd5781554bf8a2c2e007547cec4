HARARE - Zimbabwe will on Saturday join the rest of the world in marking World Pangolin Day as wildlife authorities step up efforts to help save the endangered “scaly ant-eater” and  the world’s most trafficked animal. In Zimbabwe, pangolins were placed on the Specially Protected Species Schedule in 1975. This has not changed, and under the current legislation, the pangolin plus eight other mammals are afforded higher legal protection due to their cultural importance and rarity. Pangolins are protected by the Parks and Wildlife Act [20:14] Section 128,  which details a mandatory imprisonment for a period of not less than nine years on first conviction, and on second or subsequent conviction, to imprisonment for a period of not less than 11  years. Furthermore, a fine of $5 000 may also be imposed. The pangolin is of important cultural significance in Zimbabwe. “The fact that they are being poached and trafficked to the Asian market at such a high rate in recent times is frightening. What is most disturbing is that our natural, revered heritage is being cruelly killed to satisfy a foreign market,” Kerne Mackie of Tikki Hywood Foundation said.
