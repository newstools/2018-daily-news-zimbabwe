HARARE - Both Harare City Hornets side are in for some tricky weekend fixtures in the Harare Basketball League with the men defending champions taking on in-form JBC while their women counterparts entertain Vixens in another top of the table clash at the City Sports Centre. The men’s match is the highlight of the weekend given the fact that JBC won the reverse fixture at the beginning of the season. Experience is abundant in the log leaders’ side that is coached by veteran gaffer Addison Chiware while Hornets would want to prove why they are defending champions and possibly put forward their argument that losing the first meeting was merely a fluke. Hornets have the stars to back that that plays for the senior men national team and whatever one’s preferred team it surely be a closely contested encounter. Last season, the two sides shared points with either side winning a game each and Hornets will be looking forward to a repeat of last season while JBC will be looking forward to break the jinx and maintain their dominance over the star-studded side. To put the icing on the cake will be the fixture today pitting Hornets women and Vixens while Varsity Leopards line up against a stubborn Cheetahs’ side at City Sports Centre. In the mid-week fixtures played on Tuesday and Wednesday with the organisers taking advantage of the new Robert Mugabe Youth Day Holiday Cousins fell 16-61 to JBC Women, Swagou were 36-28 victors’ over hapless Cousins while Mabvuku edged UZ Rookies 22-19 among other fixtures.
