HARARE - Zambian moneybags Buildcon Football Club have lined up a number of friendly matches with some of the country’s top sides during their intended three-week pre-season tour of Zimbabwe. The Zambian Premiership side confirmed their tour of Zimbabwe during their unveiling ceremony where 15 new players including three Zimbabwean players Nqobizitha Masuku formerly of FC Platinum, Ngezi Platinum’s Partson Jaure and Tatenda Mkuruva formerly with South Africa’s Cape Town City. “We will have a three-week training camp in Zimbabwe, we leave Zambia on February 11 and return on March 7,” Buildcon media manager Martin Masunka said during the unveiling of the three Zimbabwean players. “During the training camp in Zimbabwe, we will be able to test our mettle with Ngezi Platinum Stars, FC Platinum, CAPS United and Dynamos. “These are quite solid teams that we are going to play against in preparation for the 2018 season so the actual dates will be communicated in due course.” The ambitious Zambian side which comprises a huge contingent of foreign players from across the continent also recently appointed Italian coach Arena Gulgleimo. The Italian takes over from Spaniard Hicham Jedrane, who led Buildcon to a ninth place finish last season. Gulgleimo is a vastly experienced coach on the continent having spent 13 years in charge of clubs in Benin and Burkina Faso where he won the championships. “The team’s management was extremely satisfied with the team’s performance during the last league football season,” Masunka said. “The experience we had provided valuable learning experiences on which to build for the 2018 season. We are now regrouping for the new season with a more focussed approach in order to achieve our new targets...the team management has confidently tasked the team to win the 2018 League in order to move into the second phase of our four-year strategic plan.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
