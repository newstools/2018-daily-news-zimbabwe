HARARE - Ex-Zifa accountant Fabion Vanganayi has renewed his fight against the association insisting he did not apologise to the football governing body’s leadership for misdemeanours levelled against him. However, Zifa maintained that Vanganayi was vacillating and did not deserve to be taken seriously. The deposed Zifa accountant told the Daily News that he had not apologised — claiming that senior figures at the mother body were desperate to smear him — as part of clinging onto their leadership positions. Acting Zifa president Omega Sibanda produced 33 WhatsApp message exchanges with Vanganayi to support his claim that he was not to be trusted. “We don’t need such people in football, he’s out to destroy Zifa and he’s not the right person to comment on every football matter. If he’s man enough he should just apologise and shut up, his apology to me is enough for the whole nation. “He must respect the president of the country who has always said people should not abuse the social media, he must respect the Zifa leadership and every citizen of Zimbabwe. He wants to mislead the people, he wants to mislead our valuable sponsors and he wants to create confusion which is not there,” Sibanda told the Daily News. Vanganayi said the alleged chats, were nothing but a futile attempt to blackmail him and discredit his war against the leadership. “You see I was once very close to (Omega) Sibanda when I was at Zifa and everyone knew about that. We maintained that relationship when I left Zifa until I realised he was dishonest and using me. “He would call and expect me to chat with him on WhatsApp. That’s why I said earlier that every communication has a beginning,” Vanganayi told the Daily News yesterday. Zifa president Philip Chiyangwa, however, recused himself on the issue referring all correspondence to Sibanda, the acting president. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
