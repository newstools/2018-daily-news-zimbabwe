HARARE - The Constitutional Court (Con-Court) yesterday deferred again to March 14 the hearing of the legal challenge to government’s decision to bar expatriate Zimbabweans from voting from their foreign bases in the forthcoming key 2018 vote. Chief Justice Luke Malaba on January 18 gave the green light to three Zimbabweans living outside the country to file the application on the right to vote. Yesterday, the Con-Court deferred the hearing because the court record was not bound and the papers not paginated. “The decision of the court is to postpone this matter and allow the applicants to attend to the record. This matter will be postponed to March 14, with no order as to costs,” Justice Elizabeth Gwaunza, leading the Con-Court bench, said. The Con-Court will hear that judicial review application lodged over whether government has the power to bar Zimbabweans not resident in the country from voting in the 2018 presidential, parliamentary and municipal polls. Justice minister Ziyambi Ziyambi, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) acting chair Emmanuel Magade, Zec, Foreign Affairs minister Sibusiso Moyo, Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa and Attorney-General Prince Machaya are cited as respondents.
