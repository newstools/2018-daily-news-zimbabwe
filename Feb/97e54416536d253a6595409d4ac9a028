HARARE - Long distance runner Munyaradzi Jari expressed satisfaction with the course for today’s Lagos Marathon in Nigeria which he described as very good while also declaring that he is more than ready to hit the road this morning. The 27-year-old ZRP Athletic Club athlete is aiming a respectable finish with emphasis on finishing the race within 2:18:30 in order to brighten his chances of making it to next year’s World Championships to be held in Doha Qatar. En-route to the Lagos Marathon, Jari got himself a massive boost after winning the Nyaradzo Hac 32km Memorial Run at Old Georgians Sports Club in Harare last month which puts him in a positive frame of mind getting into the big race today. He has had a few days to acclimatise in Nigeria after leaving the country on Wednesday afternoon. “It’s going to be competitive, it’s a bit humid here but with the amount of work put in preparing for this race I think I’m going to conquer. The course is very good and just waiting to put the art into practice and hopefully come out with the desired results,” Jari told the Daily News from Nigeria yesterday. “The event being a bigger one on the athletics calendar means that it does attract several talented professionals from different countries which makes it very tough but exciting, I’m also a tough nut to crack which is why I got the invitation to participate and wouldn’t want to disappoint.” The event, the third Access Bank Lagos City Marathon is an IAAF-certified Bronze Label with routes officially measured, and with a goal to achieve Gold Label within the next two editions. Athletes who qualify and participate in this 2018 edition are automatically recognised and eligible for the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia in April. About 100 000 participants are expected to participate this year while the prize money has been upped to 3 million naira across all categories.
