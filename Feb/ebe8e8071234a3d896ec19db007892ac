HARARE - Sports and Recreation minister Kazembe Kazembe is expected to officially open the Sports and Recreation Commission’s (SRC) Governance and Compliance Conference scheduled for Harare’s Prince Edward School starting this morning. The conference will run under the theme “In Pursuit of Good Corporate Governance in the Sport and Recreation Sector,” and the minister is expected to articulate government’s position with regards to governance and compliance issues. SRC spokesperson Tirivashe Nheweyembwa said the conference is part of the 100 days projects that the local sports mother body is undertaking. “It is critical in that the conference provides an opportunity for us to interact with the National Sport Associations (NSAs) and other sport delivery agents on their obligations in as far as compliance with the SRC Act is concerned,” Nheweyembwa told the Daily News yesterday. “It is also important in that there is going to be new registration requirements which all NSAs should be aware of. “Ordinarily we would love to meet with the NSAs in such forums at least once every quarter because these are educational platforms and one can never have enough knowledge because trends in sport are changing on a daily basis hence the need to try and keep pace with them. “We hope to achieve 100 percent compliance and to also have new registration system and operator’s licence system for all NSAs which will be renewable on an annual basis. “The 100 days started on January 1 and ends on April 10. However, so far we are at 50 percent.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
