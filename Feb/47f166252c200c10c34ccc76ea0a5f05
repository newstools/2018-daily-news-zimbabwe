HARARE - Zambian sides Power Dynamos and Lusaka Dynamos are scheduled to tour Zimbabwe early next month. Local football agent Blessing Piki is organising the tour which will see the two Zambian sides take on CAPS United and Dynamos at the National Sports Stadium on March 4. The tournament will take place just a week before the start of the 2018 Castle Lager Premiership season. Piki is looking beyond the region as he plans to tie down some European clubs for friendly matches against local teams. “Last year CAPS United and Ngezi Platinum played friendly matches in Zambia, Zambian teams are very strong sides and just a quick look into the games that our
	African representatives FC Platinum played against Zanaco, they lost 4-0 and drew 0-0 against Nkana Red Devils so it is a worthwhile experience to play stronger sides on match fitness and preparing for the league,” Piki told the Daily News. Piki said that the games will certainly accord the football-starved local fans of the entertainment they should look forward to the coming season while at the same time creating a platform for the local players to showcase. Meanwhile, another Zambian side Buildcon, are also set for a lengthy pre-season tour of Zimbabwe where they will play against FC Platinum and Ngezi Platinum Stars as well as Dynamos and CAPS United.
