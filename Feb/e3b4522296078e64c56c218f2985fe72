BULAWAYO - Elegant Steps Modelling and Arts Agency (ESMA) has set next week as the day models drawn from Hwange, Bulawayo and Victoria Falls will clash in a top of the drawer belated Miss Valentines contest. The contest which will be running for the second year on the trot has been slated for Comfort Pub in the resort town of Victoria Falls on February 17.
	About 30 models are set to take it to the ramp as they fight for glory at the event. According to one of the organisers who is also in charge of choreography Method Nsingo, each of the three towns will provide 10 models for the contest.   “It is now an annual event on our calendar, where we seek to light up the resort town with our modelling showcase,” Nsingo said. “We want the people of Vic Falls to know that every year we will be bringing such a beautiful event to their doorstep,” he said. Last year, Ashley, Princess and Fikile were crowned as the top three models at a tightly contested showcase. “It was a great show and this year we promise the fans that it’s going to be bigger and better so they must not miss this one,” he said. Nsingo who is also a seasoned DJ said he will be part of those who will provide entertainment including DJ Sweeto, Alvin aka Gringo and Ms Cass who will be supported by local DJ’s Mike, Static, Mc Kayz and Dj Cleanzer. Nsingo who is working closely with DJ Sweeto in the organisation of the pageant said the event was not only meant to provide entertainment and make the successful models win at the end of the day, but also to build modelling talent. “Modelling is a career, so if you look at our cast we have young and beautiful models who we are grooming in many areas such that they can be accomplished models who can compete at national stage as well as the international stage,” he said.
