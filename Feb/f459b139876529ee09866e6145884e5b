HARARE - Masvingo United are leaving no stone unturned in their quest to rise from the ashes by adding foreign flavour to their squad ahead of the 2018 Zifa Eastern Region Division One season. Una Una have roped in Cameroonian Richard Capello, who is a holder of a Caf A and Uefa A coaching badges. The former Premiership club has also signed four new foreign players to bolster their squad as they hope to win promotion this season. The four are Democratic Republic of Congo striker Pappy Ntantwe, who has previously played for Zambian side Konkola Blades, attacking midfielder Piscus Kirenge also from the DRC as well as Ghanaians Justise Emey, a holding midfielder and striker Richard Ekulu. Former CAPS United administrator Josphat Rwafa and ex-chief executive Joe Makuvire are leading the Una Una transformation. Rwafa was appointed Masvingo United chairperson last month while Makuvire is the club’s president and looking forward to revive the side’s fortunes. “We have an obligation to restore the community’s pride and we are not too much worried about premiership football now, we will work with vision 2020 and if it happens earlier it will be a welcome bonus,” Rwafa told the Daily News. “We had at least six foreign nationals during trials and after our final evaluation on Sunday we settled for four because we also have a serious junior development policy that we are running which will see us promoting a lot of our youngsters into the senior team. Besides the foreign quartet, Masvingo also has experienced campaigners in Pedzisai Gumiremhete, Takudzwa Mahori and Tinashe Munetsi. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
