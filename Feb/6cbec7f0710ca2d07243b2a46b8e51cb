HARARE - Old Mutual will be hosting the fifth edition of the Old Mutual Harare Marathon this Sunday at Old Georgians Sports Club in Harare. The Harare Marathon has evolved with time, starting off as the Old Mutual Rodger Brackley Marathon, then Old Mutual RB Relay Challenge Marathon and then Old Mutual Relay Challenge, now it is dubbed the Old Mutual Harare Marathon. The 42,2km main race will start at 6am at OGs where athletes will be battling it out to win the main prize pegged at $1 500 for both the female and male categories.
	Registration for the event will close today and this year’s event is set to attract over 1 100 athletes from all over the country. Old Mutual has been sponsoring the Marathon since 2012 as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility initiative. Some of the top athletes at the event will use the race as a qualifier to represent Zimbabwe at both the 2018 Old Mutual Two Oceans 56km, and the Comrades Marathon. The organisation has played a major role in facilitating athletics and different sporting activities in Zimbabwe. Apart from sponsoring the Harare Marathon, Old Mutual also sponsors the Vumba Half Marathon, the Chitungwiza 10km Fun Run, the Westgate Half Marathon and the Nkulumane Fun Run. The race will bring together some of the country’s best athletes with the likes of Canicious Nyamutsitsa and Killian Matende in the men’s category along with Patience Garauzive and Olivia Chitate in the women’s category respectively. Apart from the race, there will be entertainment from seasoned DJs and children’s games. Food and drinks will be available for sale, to create a perfect platform for a family day out.
