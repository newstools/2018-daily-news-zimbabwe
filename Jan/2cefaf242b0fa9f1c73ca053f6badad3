HARARE - Zimbabwe suffered their first defeat at the ongoing ICC Under 19 World Cup yesterday going down to Australia by seven wickets further complicating the side’s chances of a quarter-final berth. After being asked to bat first, Zimbabwe fell for 134 runs inside 33.2 overs before the young Aussies breezed past the locals target in just 18.2 overs reaching 135-3. Steve Mangongo charges need to beat India in their final game to ensure a safe package to the tournament’s quarter-finals and worry not about what happens in the other encounter between Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG). Having opened the competition with a convincing 10-wicket win over hapless PNG, a win against Australia in their second match yesterday would have guaranteed Zimbabwe a ticket to the next round. However, the youthful side were weighed down by the high expectation that saw them set a measly total of 134 all out from 33.2 overs after team captain Liam Roche lost the toss and was asked to bat first at Lincoln Stadium. Robert Chiminya top scored with 27 runs batting at number eight on a day runs were hard to come by while other scores of double figures came from opener Jayden Schadendorf (16), top order batsman Milton Shumba (16), tailender Tinashe Nenhunzi (16), skipper Roche (13) and star of the first match Wesley Madhevere with 11 runs. Australia pace bowler Xavier Bartlett did most of the damage with three wickets for 20 runs in seven overs while Will Sutherland and Lloyd Pope picked two wickets apiece. Sri Lanka opener Kusal Perera dropped on 57 runs by Mire at backward point threatened to take the game of Zimbabwe’s hands with an authoritative 80 runs before he fell to a superb diving catch from rookie Blessing Muzarabani off Raza bowling.
