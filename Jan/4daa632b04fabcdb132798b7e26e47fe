Legendary jazz trumpeter Hugh Masekela, a leading figure in the struggle to end apartheid and "the father of South African jazz", has died aged 78. In a statement, his family said he had "passed peacefully" in Johannesburg "after a protracted and courageous battle with prostate cancer". Masekela gained global recognition with his distinctive Afro-Jazz sound and hits such as Soweto Blues. The 1977 song became synonymous with the anti-apartheid movement.
