HARARE - Triangle coach Taurai Mangwiro is hoping to conclude more transfers during this transfer window in order to bolster the side ahead of the start of the 2018 Castle Lager Premiership season. The Sugar Sugar Boys finished last season in ninth place with 45 points and at times flirted with relegation which they would not want to repeat this season. “At the moment we have made a number of signings and we are still working on bringing in one or two more players to strengthen the squad,” Mangwiro told the Daily News. “I wouldn’t want to divulge any names at the moment because we are still in negotiations with the players and once we are done with that, we will let you know.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The Lowveld-based side have already secured the services of highly-rated forward Delic Murimba from relegated side Hwange. Murimba, who turns 19 next month, shone in the second half of last season as he was the spearhead in Chipangano’s quest to survive the chop. In the end he finished the season with four goals but Hwange could not avoid the drop as they finished in 16th place. Triangle have also recruited goalkeeper Mariyon Chang from relegated side Tsholotsho in order to give competition to Ronald Mudimu. Well-travelled defender Arnold Chivheya has also been added to the Sugar Sugar Boys’ roster after signing from ZPC Kariba. The 29-year-old centre back has vast experience after having played for the likes of Lengthens, CAPS United and Harare City in the top flight league previously. The club has also brought in midfielder Anelka Chivandire from Zifa Eastern Region Division One side Africa Trust Another issue Mangwiro needs to sort out is finding a replacement for his assistant Godfrey Tamirepi, who has moved to ZPC Kariba as head coach. “We will be regrouping for pre-season training on January 23, next week Tuesday and I have already identified the person I want to bring in the fill the void left by Tamirepi,” he said.
