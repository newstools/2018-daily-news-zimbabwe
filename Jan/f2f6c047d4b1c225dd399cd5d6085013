HARARE - Homelux Property Development (Homelux) is seeking permission to exhume human remains at farms on the outskirts of Harare in order to establish a residential settlement. In a notice published in a Government Gazette last Friday, the property developer advised of the intention to exhume the remains at Philadelphia and Gurlyn Burton farms. “Notice is hereby given that in terms of section 38 of the.... Act, Homelux Property Development intends to engage services for the removal of human remains for the purpose of housing development of the property at Gurlyn Burton Farm, Harare,” reads part of the notice.

Its managing director, Justin Machibaya, is on record saying government should avail more land to property developers. He said as property developers, they could fully utilise the land as real estate was one of the biggest contributors to the economy. “We believe in quality houses for every Zimbabwean and we also believe in the maximum utilisation of land. This is why we came up with the cluster houses concept. We have number of projects in Harare and we promise that we will avail quality and affordable houses,” Machibaya said. Late last year, poultry producer Crest Breeders International also applied for the exhumation of human remains at its Harare South’s Saturday Retreat Estates to allow for the company’s expansion.
