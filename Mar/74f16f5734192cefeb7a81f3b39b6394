HARARE - Sungura prince First Farai, real name Aliah Mwanambo, has lined up another album titled Chandengenda (Earthquake) to be released on March 29. The 13th album follows Farai’s 2016 studio project Mukonon’ono-Hard Times which was launched at City Sports Bar in Harare. The six-track album Chandengenda was recorded at Diamond Studios. “I am still looking for the appropriate venue for the official launch, but all is ready for its release,” Farai said.   Songs making up the album are: Anochengeta, Sekuru Tibatsireiwo, Akafa Takatarisa, Simba Crashed, Ndomutenda and Vodzokera Ejipita. Farai is hopeful that the album will go a long way in entertaining fans. “I have put all of my effort on the forthcoming album. I last released an album in 2016 hence I am convinced that this album will go a long way in entertaining sungura fans as I have invested a lot of time in it,” he said.
