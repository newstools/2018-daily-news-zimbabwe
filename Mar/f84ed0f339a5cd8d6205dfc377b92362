HARARE - Black Rhinos’ Andrew Chimbidzikai and Mr Pace’s Chiedza Chokore are this year’s winners of PPC Matopos 33 Miler Ultra Marathon. Chimbidzikai was delighted after he pocketed $1 000 for winning the men’s category of the race. “The race was very competitive. I managed to hold on throughout the race and I am happy I managed to win,” Chimbidzikai said. “I pushed harder in the last stages of the race and it really paid. I also think my month of training in Mutare helped me a lot.” Chimbidzikai came home first in the tightly contested 53km race from Matopos National Park to Bulawayo in a time of 3.12.23. Nkosiyazi Sibanda was just five seconds behind coming home in 3.12.28 while Peter Tumbare was third in 3.14.21. Occupying the forth place was Marko Mambo in 3.17.08 with Bright Kudakwashe coming fifth in 3.17.47. Chokore was however adamant that the terrain was easy for her hence she was able to take first place. “The race was an easy one for me. After training in the mountainous area of Mutare it really helped me a lot,” she said. “I really never felt the high terrain and I actually never had any difficulties throughout the race. It is through hard work that I managed to win the race.” Chokore came home first in a time of 4.09.10 and was followed by Muchaneta Gwata with a time of 4.09.10 while Margaret Mahohoma was third in 4.10.01. The well organised race saw more than 2 000 athlete taking part which was pleasing to the sponsors with PPC managing director Kelobone Masiyane saying: “The race has just become bigger and better. Athletes are coming more and more year by year. “It is beneficiary for both doing it professionally and those doing it for fun and fellowshipping. “It’s a family event that has become international because of the international timing that we have introduced. We are very much pleased by the response from the athletes and the people in general.”
