HARARE - The National Social Security Authority (Nssa) has intensified efforts to make sure that all firms collecting social security contributions from employees remit them to the State-run pay-as-you-go pension scheme. There have been reports that several firms have been collecting pensions due to Nssa from employees, but have been failing to remit them to the authority. This week, Nssa said it had intensified its inspections by making onsite visits to companies in Harare to verify if they were compliant with the authority’s requirements. “The National Social Security Authority compliance inspectors will be carrying out door-to-door business inspections for all employers within the Harare region from March 12 to 23, 2018,” Nssa said in a statement. “The exercise follows the amnesty that ran from December 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018 targeting employers that were not remitting their employees’ contributions. “The authority would like to express gratitude to the companies that heeded the call to register and is encouraging employers in arrears in terms of contributions and premiums to contact Nssa  in order to arrange acceptable payment plans,” the statement added. An economic crisis that has intensified in the past few years due to a deteriorating foreign currency crisis has forced several firms to suspend paying several statutory obligations to statutory bodies. These include making contributions to Nssa and other obligations, including remitting tax to the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority. Other firms have avoided dealing with Nssa altogether, exposing their workers to potential social problems in their post-working lives. In December last year, Nssa extended an olive branch to concerned firms and gave them up to the end of February to address their arrears with the fund. The inspections are expected to move to other towns and cities across the country. — The Financial Gazette
