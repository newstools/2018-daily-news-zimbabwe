HARARE - As the 2018 Castle Lager Premiership season beckons, representatives from all top-flight league teams will meet this week in the capital, for a club licensing seminar. PSL communications manager Kudzai Bare said this will be the latest in a series of such seminars as the league works to implement a global licensing system. “The Castle Lager Premier Soccer league is holding a two-day club licensing workshop from Thursday March 15 to Friday March 16, 2018 in Harare,” Bare said in a statement. “Key objectives of the workshop includes: induction of the newly-promoted clubs, understanding the interpretations of the laws of the game, understanding the rationale behind the club licensing, security and gate controls before, during and after the matches and the importance of media in football development. “The PSL has invited governors and CEOs/general managers from all the 18 clubs to attend the workshop. It is mandatory that all the invited officials attend this important meeting. “More workshops will be held with security officers, media officers and other key stakeholders during the season.” The 2018 season is scheduled to start this weekend having been delayed last weekend. Initially the season was scheduled to have started last weekend only to be postponed following How Mine’s late withdrawal from the league.
