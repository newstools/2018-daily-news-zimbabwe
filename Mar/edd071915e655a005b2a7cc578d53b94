HARARE - Poet Tawanda Mudzinganyama, has released a Shona anthology which comprises of 16 poems as part of his efforts to give hope and comfort to prisoners and patients. The 20-paged-book was published by Wamakings Graphix. Mudzinganyama’s strong Christian values have inspired him to come up with a book of this nature. “I grew up in church, the book Zvakavanzika Zvehumambo HwaMwari seeks to give hope, restore confidence and remove bitterness to people in desperate situations including those in prisons and medical centres across the country. “It is my wish that the book will reach everyone in trying situations,” the 31-year-old-poet said. However, Mudzinganyama has managed to produce only 100 copies of the book due to financial constraints.

I wish to produce thousands of copies such that the message can reach the majority of targeted readers,” he said. Some of the poems which made up the book include “Mutsvene Wakarurama”, “Unofunga Kuti Wakafanana Neni”, “Maitiro Angu”, “Kupa Kune Rumbidzo”, “Nyama Nemweya”, “Tsime”, “Chivi” and “Rudo RwaMwari” among others. On “Mutsvene Wakarururama”, the author glorified God for his omni-presence nature. God is always available in times of need. The poem “Unofunga Kuti Wakafanana Neni” warns fake prophets to desist from their acts and instead repent to God, the Almighty. On “Maitiro Angu”, Mudzinganyama asked favour from God to conquer all the temptations of this world. “Kupa Kune Rumbidzo” is a poem which encourages people to render their support to others in need unconditionally, without expecting some favours in return. Of late, the modern church has been invaded by fake prophets who are motivated by the strong love for money. In so doing, they are leading many believers astray.
