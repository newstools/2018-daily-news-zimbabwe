HARARE - Every soldier’s wish is to become a General but not for upcoming and self-confessed Jah Prayzah copycat Jah Victory who is content with remaining a second choice to the Watora Mari hit maker. He has no plans to surpass standards set by his music icon at all. Jah Victory admits the development in his new album called Mukuru Mukuru. “Ndiri kufamba nenzira yakafambwa nevakuru and handizombofi ndakadarika mukuru…Jah Prayzah uri mukoma wangu…,” (I’m walking in the footsteps of the elders and will not surpass what they have achieved)... goes some of the lyrics on the song Mukuru Mukuru. The album was recorded at Maselo studios. Mukuru Mukuru is made up of 12 tracks: Mukuru Mukuru, Kugango, Vavengi ft Bazuka Babe, Ndiri Gamba, Chikwambo, Gotwe Rangu, Yekedero ft Baba Harare, Anotamba, Kumafaro, Nherera, Vadzimu Vangu and Ndakazvipira. From the word go, Jah Victory tried his level best to sound more or less like Jah Prayzah throughout the album. “I live Jah Prayzah,” the slim and dreadlocked chanter told the Daily News. In a previous interview, Jah Prayzah said he has no problem with copycats. “The fact that they are following my footsteps means that I am doing great work which is admired and inspire many people across the country,” Jah Prayzah said then. However, history has shown that most of the artistes who lack originality go nowhere with their music career. History has names such as Philip Gokoko who sounded more of Hosiah Chipanga, Trymore Bande whose music is often confused with that of Charles Charamba, and Obvious Mutani who imitates sungura icon Alick Macheso among others.
