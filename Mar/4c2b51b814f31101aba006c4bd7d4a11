HARARE - The second edition of CBZ Holdings’ Youth Entrepreneurship Programme (Yep), came to a high-flying conclusion on Thursday evening with 10 young entrepreneurs receiving awards. The CBZ sponsored programme which is managed by Youth Empowered Life Trust’s Jonah Mungoshi and Shingi Chitsike, is a practical and results-based initiative to produce growth-oriented profitable businesses that are run professionally by youth from all 10 Provinces in Zimbabwe. About 1183 young entrepreneurs participated in the 2017/18 edition of the “ongoing” programme which ended on Thursday evening with an award ceremony honouring 10 of the best performing participants. Ropafadzo Zimunya was honoured as the best participant of the programme, he walked away with $10 000. The 20-year-old, Mutare-based entrepreneur is the cofounder and CEO of Greenit Diversified Group, a manufacturer of banana flour and other banana based products. Speaking to The Financial Gazette on the side-lines of the award ceremony, Zimunya said even though he was very happy to receive the award and the prize money, he put more value on the experience and the lessons learnt during the programme. “I am proud to have received the award, but it’s not really about the prize money, it’s about what they have taught me, I remember very well in our first work shop, they encouraged me and my partner to raise capital, and two weeks later we had raised $5 000, so I think it’s the skills that they have imparted on us that really matter,” he said.
