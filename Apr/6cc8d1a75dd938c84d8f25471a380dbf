The event, to be held at Longcheng Plaza will feature musicians Trevor Dongo, Simba Tagz, Stunner and Junior Brown among others. The album is made up of 18 tracks. “I regard this album as my best work ever. I took my time working on it. Initially, I wanted to release the album last year but I deleted it as I was not happy about it. “I recorded another album which I am going to unveil this Friday. I have confidence on this one,” the 28-year-old artiste said. Takura ventured into music industry in 2014 with the group Soul Africa before going solo two years later when he released the hit Zino Irema.
